*CVS Log info
*$Log$
*Revision 1.1.2.1  2004/04/28 03:29:41  ddiego
*migration towards new directory structure
*
*Revision 1.5.2.1  2004/04/26 21:58:21  marcelloptr
*changes for dir reorganization: _VCF_MACRO_H__
*
*Revision 1.5  2004/04/03 15:48:40  ddiego
*Merged over code from the 0-6-3 branch.
*
*Revision 1.4.2.1  2004/02/15 20:24:01  ddiego
*intial Locales implementation is now checked in. This adds several new classes, namely:
*The LocalePeer, which is the OS generic peer for interfacing with teh OS for lcoale support
*The Locale class which provides locale support for the vcf
*The Win32LocalePeer which provides a basic Win32 implementation for locale support
*The UnicodeString class, which is a near identical class to the std::string class and provides a wrapper around a std::basic_string<wchar_t>. This also adds support for translating to and from ansi strings, and supporting text encoding via a TextEncoder class.
*The TextCodec class which allows for custom text codec for encoding or decoding text.
*The MessageLoader class which is used to provide localized string translation
*The StringsMessageLoader which provides a basic implementation of string loading and translation that is compatible with Apples .strings resource files.
*
*Revision 1.4  2003/12/18 05:15:57  ddiego
*merge from devmain-0-6-2 branch into the stable branch
*
*Revision 1.3.4.1  2003/10/23 04:24:50  ddiego
*more musical chairs with headers again, in yet another attempt to make
*them more efficent to speed up compiles.
*Removed all teh template RTTI classes and put them all in one header
*called VCFRTTIImpl.h. This should help compile speeds a bit.
*The next step is to look at some of the event classes and remove ones
*that aren't really neccessary - I'd estimate that 50% of the current
*event classes are unneccessary and can be removed.

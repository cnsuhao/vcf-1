*is set.
*
*Revision 1.8  2003/05/17 20:37:08  ddiego

*
*Revision 1.7  2003/02/26 04:30:39  ddiego
*merge of code in the devmain-0-5-9 branch into the current tree.

*still under development) and the change over to using the Delegate class
*exclusively from the older event handler macros.
*
*Revision 1.6.8.1  2002/12/25 22:06:26  ddiego
*whole bunch of little changes to the header files used by the ApplicationKit
*to get rid of no newline warnings by gcc.

*bugs fixed:
*[ 585085 ] Can't get at multi selected filenames - this was just a matter of exposing a function that was already available in the
*peer class
*
*features:
*58839 Add a method to query closing a Frame, this required a change that included added a new event (FrameEvent and the corresponding
*FrameEventHandler) and a method, bool Frame::allowClose()
*
*Also made fixes in the VCF Builder to now take advantage of this, so the MainWindow class will now register an event
*handler to handler the FrameClosing event, and attempt to set the current workspace to NULL. If this does not happen then
*the closing event will fail and prevent the widnow from being shutdown. Woo hoo !
*
*Revision 1.5  2002/01/24 01:46:48  ddiego
*added a cvs "log" comment to the top of all files in vcf/src and vcf/include
*to facilitate change tracking
